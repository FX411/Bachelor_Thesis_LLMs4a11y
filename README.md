# Bachelor_Thesis_LLMs4a11y
This repository contains the practical implementation of my bachelor's thesis titled:

"Determining the potential of multimodal large language models to meet the requirements of the European Accessibility Act in online stores"
("Ermittlung der Potenziale von multimodalen Large Language Models zur Erfüllung der Anforderungen des Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetzes in Online-Shops")

In this thesis I am testing three different, popular LLMs in regards to their potential to help with WCAG conformity of online stores. 
One test I have conducted is the automated correction of inaccessible website code in Jenkins pipelines. The code in this repository is used to conduct those tests.
